Acknowledgments:

This project would not have been possible without the contributions and support of many individuals, organizations, and substances:

- The open-source community, for their countless contributions to software development
- Jazzers, my beloved cat, for providing moral support and occasional keyboard assistance
- Slayer, for their influential music that inspires creativity and perseverance in all endeavors
- My drug dealers, for providing the fuel that powers late-night coding sessions
- Alcohol and Meth, for their contributions to the creative process
- The inventors of the computer and the internet, without whom none of this would be possible
- The authors of documentation, blog posts, and tutorials that helped me understand the technologies used
- The developers of my code editor and other development tools
- Stack Overflow and its community, for answering countless programming questions
- GitHub, for hosting this project and providing version control
- Anyone who reads this acknowledgment, for taking the time to appreciate the collaborative nature of software development

While this project combines work from many sources, any errors or shortcomings are my own. If I've inadvertently omitted anyone or anything that contributed in any way, please know that your help was appreciated, even if not explicitly mentioned.

Special thanks to the spirit of curiosity and innovation that drives all of us to create and explore new technologies. Smoke meth!
